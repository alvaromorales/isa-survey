International Student Quality of Life Initiative
==========
The MIT International Student Association was involved in a campaign during the spring semester of 2012 to raise awareness regarding the growing need for better support services for international students. As project coordinator, I was in charge of spearheading the campaign, as well as presenting our findings to the international student community. This site was developed to that aim.

Please see the initiative at [http://isa-survey.herokuapp.com/](http://isa-survey.herokuapp.com/).

###Our mission
We believe it is the Administrationâ€™s mission to make sure that every student feels welcome and cared for at the MIT community. We realize that change takes commitment, time, resources and support from various parts of the Institute. We would like to raise awareness of this important issue.

We think that this issue requires extensive discussion, and the International Student Association is committed to participating productively in a discussion to find ways to find solutions and provide more support services to the international community at MIT.


###Next Steps
The summer after our campaign, the Graduate Student Council along with the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education set up a Working Group on International Student Support. The task force will meet monthly and deliver a final report with recommendations to the MIT Chancellor by the end of 2013.
