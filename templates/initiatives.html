		<h3>Overview</h3>

		<p>
			The following document highlights initiatives that the ISA would like to pursue with the help of different divisions of the Institute. These initiatives have been compiled primarily using the First-Year Mentor Program report, the 2013 International Student Quality of Life Survey results, and the experiences described by numerous graduate and undergraduate international students. We have also looked at what kinds of support services for international students are available at other top-tier universities.<br/ ><br/ >
			As a student organization, we are aware of the depth, breadth and scope of the following initiatives. We realize that change takes commitment, time, resources and support from various parts of the Institute. The initiatives highlighted in this document range from things that can be easily implemented to those that will take Institute-wide collaboration to achieve. <br/ ><br/ >
			Over the last few weeks we have reached out to different levels and divisions of MIT, including the International Students Office (ISO), MIT Mental Health and Counseling, Student Support Services and the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Education. As executive board members of ISA, we hope to serve as facilitators in this long-lasting process through which MIT administration and the international community can work together to enhance the quality of life for international students at MIT. <br/ ><br/ >
			We see this document as a starting place to initiate a productive conversation with different members of the MIT community, and <b>not</b> as a document that highlights "demands" or "recommendations" of the ISA. <br/ ><br/ >
			<b>This is only a list of the initiatives. For the full description, please read <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsudoj3zsfcxlwu/Initiatives.pdf'>the PDF version</a>.</b><br/ ><br/ >
