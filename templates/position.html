		<h3>The initiative</h3>

		<p>
		In the recent past, two suicides have shaken the international community. In response, the ISA launched the First-Year Mentor Program last semester (Fall 2012). Incoming freshmen of the 2016 class were assigned upperclassmen mentors, in an effort to bring together the international community and have the mentors provide guidance and share their experiences with the new students. The program was piloted successfully last semester, and we plan to continue it in the future. We see in the First-Year Mentorship program a way of providing more support to international students.<br/ ><br/ >
		From the feedback of our mentors and mentees, we have come to realize that there is an unmet need for better support services for international students. Earlier this semester, the ISA ran the International Student Quality of Life survey, open to all our members, and the results confirmed many of our opinions. We have approached different members of the MIT administration with our findings. Specifically, we have had conversations with MIT Mental Health, Student Support Services, the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Education and the International Students Office (ISO).<br/ ><br/ >
		From the feedback we had from our members, and the conversations with MIT administration, the International Student Association has come to the following conclusions:<br/ ><br/ >

		<h3>Perception of the ISO</h3>
		<p>

		We have found that the MIT Administration, such as faculty members, counselors or deans, see the ISO as one of the main support services for international students. Many offices refer international students to the ISO for a wide range of issues. We think this is a natural assumption, given that the ISO’s mission in their website seems to indicate this:<br/ ><br/ >
		<i>The ISO serves all incoming and currently enrolled international students at the Institute. The ISO assists students in maintaining their legal status in the United States, provides support for their dependents, and promotes interaction with and integration into the MIT community at large.</i>
		<a class='pull-right' href='http://web.mit.edu/iso/'>http://web.mit.edu/iso/</a><br/ ><br/ ><br/ >

		<i>The ISO also sponsors events and programs to help students adjust to life in the US and at MIT, and provides counseling related to emergencies and unexpected immigration problems.</i>
		<a class='pull-right' href='http://web.mit.edu/iso/about/iso.shtml'>http://web.mit.edu/iso/about/iso.shtml</a><br/ ><br/ ><br/ >

		<h3>Legal Issues</h3>
		<p>
		We believe the ISO does a great job in handling the complex legal situation that involves maintaining the legal status of international students at MIT. We have discussed with the ISO the complexities of immigration law for students, especially in the post-9/11 era. Because of the heavy time requirements that this role entails, we believe the main function of the ISO is to provide legal support for international students, and that legal issues take up the majority of the office’s time.<br/ ><br/ >

		<h3>Student Support</h3>
		<p>
		We believe that student support is defined as the day-to-day advocacy and counseling of students. A support service for international students should work to build a strong international community at MIT. It should have knowledgeable staff that can help a student navigate the wide array of resources at MIT. We see the Office of Minority Education (OME) as the perfect example on campus of a student support service. International students are not legally qualified as a minority, although undergraduate international students make up only 9% of the undergraduate student body.<br/ ><br/ >
		We believe that international students require specialized support services with staff that is very aware of all the implications of being a student in a foreign country, and is qualified to deal with the issues that arise from these implications. From our survey results, we have found that international students first seek other international students when faced with some problem, small or big. We believe that having an office with an international focus on support services is an urgent need for the international community at MIT.<br/ ><br/ >
		<h3>The ISO and student support</h3>
		<p>
		Based on the comments from our survey, we believe that the ISO does not sufficiently cater to international students in terms of student support. While the ISO has historically provided support to students, the changes in the legal landscape has resulted in student support services becoming a secondary priority for the ISO. However, the ISO maintains that as an office they continue to provide advocacy for international students. Our survey shows that the majority of international students do not resort to the ISO for non-legal and non-immigration related support. <br/ ><br/ >
		In addition, the responses indicate that the ISO is not the most welcoming place on campus. Our conversations with the ISO have revealed that during busy times, it can take up to a week to schedule an appointment with an ISO advisor. Because legal advocacy takes up the majority of the office’s time, we feel that the time allocated to student support and building the international community is not sufficient for the needs of a population that makes up 9% of the undergraduate body and nearly 40% of the graduate body.<br/ ><br/ >

		<h3>Our mission</h3>
		<p>
		We believe it is the Administration’s mission to make sure that every student feels welcome and cared for at the MIT community. We realize that change takes commitment, time, resources and support from various parts of the Institute. We would like to raise awareness of this important issue.<br/ ><br/ >			
		We think that this issue requires extensive discussion, and the International Student Association is committed to participating productively in a discussion to find ways to find solutions and provide more support services to the international community at MIT.
