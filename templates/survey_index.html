		<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

		<p>
Please note that this survey is <b>not an institutionally approved survey</b>. We had a response rate of 27.7% undergraduates and 2% of graduate international students. When reading the survey results please keep the following in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The results are <b>not representative</b> of the <b>entire</b> international student body. We had a total of 222 responses, and it is possible that we have a sample bias in our results. Our results maybe more 'negative' than feelings of the larger student population.</li>

<li><p>We are not drawing conclusions from the survey, nor extrapolating the data to support our programs. </li>

<li><p>The survey shows responses to every question we asked, except for the anonymous student responses. At this time, we are not publishing the comments of students. The comments are all anonymous. However, we believe the comments showcase important opinions on our campus. If you would like access to them, please get in touch with us.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lastly, these results are meant to stimulate a <b>constructive</b> conversation around the concept of student support for the international community. We encourage you to talk about your experiences with other people in a way that remains respectful of everyone who are involved in providing us support today.

			<h3>Motivations</h3>
		<p>
			Approximately 9% of the undergraduate student body and 40% of the graduate student body are international students. There is a larger body of students who are legally American, but have never lived in the United States. Over the years the ISA has heard numerous stories of students who love MIT but struggle to find a supportive community.<br/ ><br/ >
			This semester we wanted to hear the voices of the larger community. In the recent past Chancellor Grimson advertised the Student Quality of Life Survey. We, at the ISA, took the survey and realized that despite its length there were few questions pertaining to international students. Of course we are members of the MIT community, but our needs are somewhat distinct from the domestic students. We took this opportunity and designed our own survey. We took questions from Chancellor Grimson's survey and tailored them to our (the international community's) needs and requirement.<br/ ><br/ >
			The following 10-minute survey was open to the students, namely the international community for a just one week. All responses were anonymous and will be kept that way. The students were questioned on their social, academic, and personal well-being. In addition they were asked to evaluate the different resources on campus.<br/ ><br/ >
